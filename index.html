      <h2>A MILESTONE</h2>
      <h5>by Dr. Satya Bhushan</h5>
      <p>The best approach to learn about the most recent and forthcoming inventions worldwide is at conferences. Many researchers worked hard in 2022 and produced some significant discoveries that will be discussed in these conferences.

        In order to propel developing technology, an International Conference on Automation & Computation (AutoCom 2022) was held in Uttarakhand at Graphic Era Hill University in December 2022.
        The conference was sponsored by DRDO and USERC and organised in partnership with IRDE and DRDO.
        
        We're thrilled to inform you all that Dr. Satyabhushan Verma (HOD, Computer Science & Engineering) has demonstrated success for his outstanding research contribution on the several topics and has been titled with YOUNG SCIENTIST AWARD</p>
